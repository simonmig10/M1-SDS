# load data

```{r}
data <- read_csv("startup data.csv", 
col_types = cols(founded_at = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y"), 
first_funding_at = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y"), 
last_funding_at = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y")))
```

# data celaning

We take a quick look at the data
```{r}
glimpse(data)
```


We start by removing columns we dont know what is as they are not described when loading the dataset.
Also some of the columns show the same thing, 

```{r}

data %<>%
  select(!c(`Unnamed: 0`, `Unnamed: 6`, status, state_code.1, object_id, avg_participants))

glimpse(data)

```

To look how wholesome the data is we skim the data

```{r}

skim(data)

```

```{r}

data %<>%
  mutate(closed_at= replace_na(closed_at, "still going"))

```


```{r}
skim(data)
```


```{r}

#We make intervals for first milestone
data %<>%
  mutate(age_first_milestone_year= ifelse(age_first_milestone_year <0,"before year 0",ifelse(age_first_milestone_year <= 3 , "[0-3]", ifelse(age_first_milestone_year <= 6, "]3-6]", ifelse(age_first_milestone_year <=9, "]6-9]", ifelse(age_first_milestone_year > 9, "over 9", "")))))) %>%
  mutate(age_first_milestone_year= replace_na(age_first_milestone_year, "no milestone"))

#We make intervals for last milestone
data %<>%
  mutate(age_last_milestone_year= ifelse(age_last_milestone_year <0,"before year 0",ifelse(age_last_milestone_year <= 3 , "[0-3]", ifelse(age_last_milestone_year <= 6, "]3-6]", ifelse(age_last_milestone_year <=9, "]6-9]", ifelse(age_last_milestone_year > 9, "over 9", "")))))) %>%
  mutate(age_last_milestone_year= replace_na(age_last_milestone_year, "no milestone"))

skim(data)
